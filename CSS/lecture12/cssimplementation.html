    <h1> CSS it depends on four key factors:</h1>
    <pre>
        1.Importance (Origin)
          Inline styles (style attribute) > Internal styles External styles (<link> tag)
          Browser default styles have the lowest priority.
        2.Specificity
          Specific selectors (like IDs) take precedence over less specific ones (like classes or element selectors).
          Example: #id > .class > tag
        3.Source Order
          When selectors have the same specificity, the one declared last in the code will be applied.
        4.Inheritance
          Some properties (like text color and font) are inherited from parent elements, while others (like margin and padding) are not.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        If you keep important then it is given the most priority
        Otherwise the order is:
        Inline > Internal > External
        Otherwise it also checks the source code and which is on the last of the code that is having more priority.
    </pre>
